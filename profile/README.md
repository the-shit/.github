# THE SHIT

**Developer tools that don't suck.**

We build autonomous agent infrastructure that ships production code. No hand-holding, no babysitting, no bullshit.

## What We Build

**[Conduit](https://github.com/conduit-ui)** - GitHub automation suite for AI agents
Composable PHP packages that give agents GitHub superpowers. Create issues, manage PRs, trigger workflows, review code.

**[Agents](https://github.com/the-shit/agents)** - Laravel Zero CLI for autonomous development
Ship-agents GitHub App interface. Point it at a repo, watch it work.

**[Chat](https://github.com/the-shit/chat)** - Multi-model orchestration layer
Human-in-the-loop command center. Laravel 12 + Inertia + Vue 3.

## Philosophy

**Swarm methodology** - Parallel agents attack problems from multiple angles
**Mob programming for AI** - Architect, implement, test, review in parallel
**Humans orchestrate** - Strategic guidance, not line-by-line coding
**Bad PR > No PR** - Ship fast, iterate faster

We follow Musk's Algorithm:
1. Question the requirement
2. Delete unnecessary complexity
3. Simplify
4. Accelerate
5. Automate

## The Vision

Issues are suggestions. Commits are attempts. PRs are proposals.
**Humans curate. Agents execute.**

## Join the Swarm

- Open issues on any repo
- Ship PRs (yes, even bad ones)
- Build packages for the Conduit ecosystem
- Run autonomous agents in production
