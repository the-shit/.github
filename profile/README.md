# THE SHIT

**Scaling Humans Into Tomorrow**

Autonomous agent swarms that ship code while you sleep.

## The Stack

| Layer | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| [chat](https://github.com/the-shit/chat) | Human orchestration layer |
| [agents](https://github.com/the-shit/agents) | Laravel Zero agent CLI |
| [conduit](https://github.com/conduit-ui) | Agent verbs for GitHub |

## Philosophy

**Joe Justice Principles:**
- Swarm methodology - parallel agents attack problems
- Mob programming for AI - architect, implement, test, review
- Humans as orchestrators - strategic guidance, not line-by-line coding
- Bad PR > No PR - ship fast, iterate faster

**Musk's Algorithm:**
1. Question the requirement
2. Delete unnecessary complexity
3. Simplify
4. Accelerate
5. Automate

## The Vision

Issues are suggestions. Commits are attempts. PRs are proposals. Humans curate.
